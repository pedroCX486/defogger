Please contact me on bjorn@mork.no if you have questions, comments or
just want to say hi.

But please note that I won't be able to provide any support for this.
I am making this information available for educational purposes.  If
you find it useful, then great!  If you brick a camera, then I am
truly sorry about that.  But there isn't much I can do about it...
