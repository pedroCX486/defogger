This repo is a fork, from the original by bmork, here I'm just fixing a couple scripting and spelling mistakes, and also tuning it to how my experience went while doing this process. Files have been reorganized into a wiki style documentation for ease of access.

Please note: **This doesn't change the process itself, not compatibility with the models previously added by bmork, nor I plan to support anything else. I'm just reorganizing things for myself.**

This is still under construction!
